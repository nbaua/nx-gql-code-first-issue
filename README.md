## nx-gql-code-first-issue

This repository is a trimmed down version of a Nest/Nx/Graphql project which tries to reproduce the issue with graphql code-first approach.

```
- Just clone/fork this repository and update the required packages
- Once done, locate the Import section in app.module.ts under the API project
  and uncomment lines 16-21 or so to reproduce the issue.
```

I've tried to be as animalistic as possible on this repository, apologies if I've missed something while reproducing this issue. Please participate in the discussion thread on the GitHub for more details here.
